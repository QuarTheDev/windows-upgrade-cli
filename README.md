## `windows-upgrade-cli`

### ⚠️ Notice: Discontinuation

After 10 months of the release of `windows-upgrade-cli`, I regret to inform that the discontinuation of this project is now in effect. The decision comes as a result of the outdated nature of the code, as well as the availability of better alternatives.

`windows-upgrade-cli` will no longer receive updates or support. The tool remains (and always has remained) free of charge and free as in freedom.

**✨ Alternatives**

I've put together some excellent alternatives that you could use instead.

I appreciate the nonexistent support and usage of `windows-upgrade-cli` during its active period. If you have any inquiries or concerns, you can reach out to me at my email [`quarthedev@pm.me`](mailto:quarthedev@proton.me). This repository has been archived, but there may be a successor in the future.

Thank you
